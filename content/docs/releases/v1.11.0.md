## Changes since last release



### Update vpp version

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/govpp/issues/9)


## System stability fixes and improvements



### Add VPP config for ARM



Add vpp config for ARM. The config will be the same as in this PR - https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-forwarder-vpp/pull/905


[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/vpphelper/issues/1)


### Update all cmd-*-vpp repos that use edwarnicke/vpphelper

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/vpphelper/issues/4)


### `Update dependent repositories` workflow does update incorrectly

`integration-k8s-kind` re-uses [.github workflow](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-dependent-repositories-gomod.yaml)
This is wrong, because this workflow updates `integration-k8s-kind` instead of `integration-tests` in dependent repositories (public clusters).
For example:
https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-kind/actions/runs/5656999510/job/15325140836

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/integration-k8s-kind/issues/862)


### Feature Request: Allow configuration of initContainer resource requests and limits

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-admission-webhook-k8s/issues/292)


### Allow setting of registration url via env variable

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-nse-simple-vl3-docker/issues/119)


### "Permission tests" job runs even if there aren't tests require permission in the repo

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/.github/issues/40)


### reconnect services dynamically

Status: RESOLVED.

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/issues/9767)


### IPSec takes a lot of time on request

Our current implementation uses IKEv2, that requires `rsa` key. 
The thing is the key generation takes about 3-5s - https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-vpp/blob/main/pkg/networkservice/mechanisms/ipsec/common.go

[See more details](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/sdk-vpp/issues/745)
